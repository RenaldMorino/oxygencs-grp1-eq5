# LOG-680 : Template for Oxygen-CS

This Python application continuously monitors a sensor hub and manages HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) system actions based on received sensor data.

It leverages `signalrcore` to maintain a real-time connection to the sensor hub and utilizes `requests` to send GET requests to a remote HVAC control endpoint.

This application uses `pipenv`, a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds to the Python world.

## Requierements

- Python 3.8+
- pipenv

## Getting Started

Install the project's development dependencies :

```bash
pipenv install -d
```

Install the pre-commit hook to lint and format commits :

```bash
pipenv run pre-commit install
```

if the `pipenv` command does not work, you can try with these commands instead :

```bash
python3 -m pipenv --python /the/python3/binary/location install -d

python3 -m pipenv --python /the/python3/binary/location run pre-commit install
```

On linux, the default python3 path is : `/usr/bin/python3`

## Setup

You need to setup the following variables inside `/.env` file:

- HOST: The host of the sensor hub and HVAC system.
- TOKEN: The token for authenticating requests.
- T_MAX: The maximum allowed temperature.
- T_MIN: The minimum allowed temperature.
- DATABASE_URL: The database connection URL.

## Running the Program

After setup, you can start the program with the following command:

```bash
pipenv run start
```

## Logging

The application logs important events such as connection open/close and error events to help in troubleshooting.

## To Implement

There are placeholders in the code for sending events to a database and handling request exceptions. These sections should be completed as per the requirements of your specific application.
